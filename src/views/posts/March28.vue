        Yesterday I decided to take a break from coding.  Given the massive amount of work I had done between my
        actual Software Engineering job and this project, I really needed a break in order to clear my head and
        start fresh today.  Thankfully COD War Zone is a thing now.  It’s a great way to get really distracted if
        you haven’t checked it out yet.

        Due to the strict nature of quarantine policies, I also made the decision to travel to Kansas City today
        in order to spend this down time with my family, rather than being cooped up in my apartment all alone.
        Yes, I understand the necessity to not travel under these conditions.  However, given my limited exposure
        to the outside world, and taking necessary PPE precautions along my route, I knew I could prevent spreading the virus.

        Also, for those of you who are curious if you have come into contact with someone who has been confirmed
        to have contracted COVID, I would highly recommend downloading the app: PrivateKit.  While it tracks your
        location data, you can be ensured that due to the highly encrypted nature of the application and the app’s
        strict focus on privacy, that your location data is safe.  It does provide a very user friendly representation
        of where you have been while also showing areas where cases have been confirmed, so it is a great tool to
        have during this pandemic.

        In terms of development, I have decided that rather than taking the easy route and working with a Firebase
        backend, that I will instead work on my real skills and delve into the world of Express and MongoDB.  These
        are two technologies which are becoming huge in the world of user-facing applications, so adding them to my
        toolbelt will be excellent.  Don’t get me wrong.  I will for sure prefer setting up backend API’s in either
        ASP.NET Core with C# or Django with Python, but this will be a way to show some diversity in my development
        environment.  While I was very inclined to work with GraphQL, this application’s simplicity negates the need
        for a middleware to specify queries, which is precisely what GraphQL is primarily used for.

        Beard update:  It is still growing, but it is also getting extremely itchy.  I finally paid attention to
        some advice from fellow beard growers and invested in some beard oil, so I am really hoping it does the trick.
        I’m also still crossing my fingers that the patchiness on the sides starts to fade, but I’m losing a bit of
        hope on that endeavor.  Regardless, I will still keep this thing alive as long as the quarantine continues.
