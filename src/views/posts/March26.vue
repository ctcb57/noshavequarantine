        First thing first: I’m officially out of the Army.  I enlisted August 25, 2009 and this journey finally
        came to an end March 26, 2020.  I met some great people, did some cool things, and visited some amazing
        places along the way, so I have no regrets about my decision to serve.

        Now onto the website updates.  Today I actually started to build the website.  This is arguably one of the
        most difficult parts of any project because it forces the developer to decide exactly how they want the
        website to look.  I will admit, I do not have any background with UI/UX or graphic design, so my biggest
        fear is making this website look like crap.  With that being said, I’ll do my best to make this a beautiful,
        user-friendly website.

        I figured that I would start by building the blog element of the page first since that would be the easiest.
        However, at this point, I realized I would have to set up some sort of back-end for the website along with a
        database.  This is mostly because I’ll be forced to store images and blog posts which need to be easily retrievable.
        I’m still torn between doing this with Firebase or building my first GraphQL Back-end.

        After revealing the website’s launch, some friends contacted me and made what is arguably the first feature
        request.  Since I’m not the only one in the world refusing to shave due to this quarantine, others would
        like to share their photos as well.  Due to this, it really requires an entire architectural shift in the
        website, but a shift I’m more than willing to do.  Plus, setting up this functionality allows people from all
        over to be able to get in with the fun as well, while also presenting a fun challenge to me.  This feature
        also necessitates the creation of user authorization so people can login and upload their actual pictures
        which will be a cool feature to implement.

        All around, this is a great challenge which will undoubtedly keep me busy as feature requests continue to
        come in.  I wouldn’t have it any other way when it comes to doing what I love while also learning new things along the way.

        In other news, the beard is finally starting to come in.  I will admit, however, that it is quite patchy.
        I made a remark that it’s making me look a bit homeless.  Yet, a friend reminded me when I started this journey
        that Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither is a beard.  I’ll keep going forward with it and hopefully it grows
        into a beautiful thing.  Or it comes in really disgusting which will give everyone some great entertainment.
        Totally worth it.
