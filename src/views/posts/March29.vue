        I have finally figured out the path forward for building the website.  Just as I do with my day job,
        I will be starting with creating the User Interface for the components and pages which will ultimately
        make up the website.  By using VueJS, I’ll be able to really get a better grasp of many of the tooling
        features which will for sure help out at work.

        After the components are built, I will then move to creating a robust back-end which will utilize Express
        as the back-end framework, and then either MongoDB or PostgresQL as the database.  The decision between a
        NoSQL or MySQL database has been a difficult one since the majority of my experience is with relational
        databases.  However, knowing that MongoDB is getting huge, it may be worth taking a journey down this path.

        After this back-end is set up, I will then start to incorporate basic things such as setting up user
        authentication/authorization, a REST API to feed the blog posts and images to the front-end, and finishing
        it with testing by using a relatively new testing framework called Cypress.  I’ve had terrible experiences
        with Selenium, so I’m looking forward to trying out a new End to End Testing Framework.

        Lastly, it’s just a matter of connecting the backend with the front end to ensure all functionality is present.
        Once this is accomplished, it will be time to deploy the back end of the website.  In the meantime, I will be
        spinning up some basic static pages which will be able to present content to anyone visiting the site before
        it is completely functional.  I’ll try to keep this updated as much as possible, but the ultimate goal is to
        transform the website from one that is strictly static, to one that is dynamic.

        For the beard, the time has come to take measures to really start caring for it.  The amount of itchiness is
        almost unbearable, and the new discovery of “beard dandruff” has been pretty annoying.  One thing people
        also don’t mention is the notion of beard acne which causes it’s own discomfort.  Despite all of these issues,
        I will still keep moving forward with the growth of the beard.
