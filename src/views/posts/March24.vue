          The quarantine from COVID-19 has finally gotten to me. I’ve decided to not only grow a beard,
          but also create a website hosting updates of the beard’s evolution.

        This is what happens when you’re cooped up in your apartment for multiple days in a row.
        Don’t get me wrong, I’m really counting my blessings that I have a roof over my head, food on the table,
        and a great job which allows me to work remotely.  But I’d also be lying if I didn’t admit that I’m starting
         to go a bit stir crazy due the lack of human interaction.

        Thus the idea for growing the beard.  This can actually be attributed to the conclusion of my military career.
          After a long 10 ½ years, I finally decided to hang up the boots and leave the service.
          However, I didn’t just want to put away my uniforms and call it good.  Rather, I wanted to do something to
          celebrate this new found freedom.

        I originally thought about growing out my hair.  But then I quickly remembered how horrendous I look with long hair.
        My genetics cause it to get extremely curly, so pulling it off wouldn’t be very glorious at the ripe age of 30.
        The alternative option was to grow a beard.  I mean, beards are in now.  Everyone is growing them.
        Women on dating apps constantly insist that they prefer men with beards.  So what the hell.
        I guess that means it’s time to grow a beard.

        Yet, growing a beard in isolation would be a really boring and uneventful adventure, so I figured I might as well
        share this journey with the world.  Hence the birth of this website.  It gives me an opportunity to hone my craft as a Software Developer and ultimately provide
        some laughs to people who are searching for some good in the world.

        But it doesn’t end there.  I also want this to end up going to a good cause.  Our health care workers are out
        there working their asses off to contain this virus and keep people alive.  Unfortunately, they do not have
        the necessary protective equipment to keep themselves safe from the virus.  Therefore, I am encouraging people
        to donate to Direct Relief in order to support health care workers. This organization is working diligently to
        provide gloves, protective masks, and gowns to health care workers to keep them safe.  As long as visitors of
        this website are donating to this charity, I will keep the beard going, no matter how disgusting it gets.

        <p>I'm looking forward to sharing this adventure with each and every one of you.</p>
